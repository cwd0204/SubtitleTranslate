00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.840
fishing and hunting are important
sources of food in yakutia

2
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.800
because it's simply impossible to grow fruits
and vegetables due to the harsh climate

3
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.720
in the late autumn before the cold winter
comes yogurts are preparing for their annual

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.280
traditional fishing event known as munkha munkha
is a traditional ice fishing using a seine net

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:43.920
the whole village gathered together to
take part in this massive fishing activity

6
00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.360
yakuts are always helping and supporting each
other especially when it comes to food they

7
00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:57.840
know that without each other's help it's
difficult to survive in this cold icy land

8
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.440
every autumn during manhattan annual ice fishing
locals can get several hundred kilograms of fish

9
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.680
at a time fishing under the ice demands
a lot of effort and coordinated teamwork

10
00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.720
the process itself turned into a mass festival

11
00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.120
every village has a wise elderly
man who knows the local terrain well

12
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:39.840 position:63% line:0%
and gather all the locals together

13
00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:55.440
believe in the spirits in animals trees lakes and
fire before fishing starts local feeds by an eye

14
00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.760
the spirits of the forest and lakes by putting
pancakes on the fire to ask for successful fishing

15
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.280
everyone feels excited locals
make teams of up to 20 people

16
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.520
with one the most experienced person usually
the oldest to be the leader he is acting on

17
00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.840
his intuition and experience and
deciding where to place the net

18
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.080
one of the teams then gets the
net ready while the other prepares

19
00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.840
two large holes in the eyes
in which to be placed the nut

20
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.320
a series of small holes are then
made between the two big ones

21
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.840
to allow the knife to be pulled from one end
to the other using wooden sticks with hooks

22
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.480
as the nuts get into the water the other team

23
00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.480
used their long sticks in the water
to make the fish move towards the net

24
00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.680
as a result the net runs along almost the entire
perimeter of the lake guaranteeing the catch

25
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:47.040
the strongest pull the net faster prevent the
fish from escaping today woman can take part in

26
00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.000
traditional ice fishing but in ancient
times only man could participate in it

27
00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.720
locals also believe that a black crow
circling in the sky is a good sign

28
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:13.840
they know that they will not be left without food
and are frequent guests during the ice fishing

29
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.640
everyone holds their breath when
the fishermen pulled the net

30
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:55.840
they hope this year is favorable for ice
fishing and they won't be left without food

31
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:18.400
when the fishermen finally put
the net out everyone feels excited

32
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.160
luckily this year was great for fishing
locals have enough food to survive the long

33
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:37.840
cold winter and that's why Yakutsk
great moon high fishing like a big day

34
00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.160
another exciting and long-awaited
part is sharing the fish

35
00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:59.360
the main role is to share the catch with
everyone even if they are not taking part

36
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.840
they share several bags filled with fish and
freeze them to eat during the whole winter

37
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:14.080
locals are always taking care of the lakes they
won't do any fishing in this lake for three years

38
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.840
in order to not disturb the
ecological balance of the lake

39
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:12.480
this is how Yakuts are living and enjoying their
life in the coldest inhabited place on earth

40
00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:29.840
we believe that life is hard but so very beautiful
